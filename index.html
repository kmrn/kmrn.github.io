          I'm a developer. That's me over to the left. I enjoy making cool things, meeting new people, and trying new foods! My resume has my work history and skills, that projects page has a list of stuff I've worked on, and that blog is just there I guess. You can get a hold of me on various social networks or just with an email.

          Newman: I'm a little offended, Jerry. Jerry: You're not a little anything, Newman. Jerry: But I don't wanna be a pirate! George: Who buys an umbrella anyway? You can get them for free at the coffee shop in those metal cans. Jerry: Men want the same thing from their underwear that they want from women: a little bit of support, and a little bit of freedom. George: I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind their backs. George [about his father]: During that period when my folks were separated, he went a little crazy. George: The sea was angry that day, my friends. Like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli.
