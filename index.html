				My name is Kamran and I'm a developer. That's me over to the left. I enjoy making new things, meeting new people, and trying new foods! My resume has my full work history and skills, that projects page has a list of stuff I've worked on, and that blog is just there I guess.

				<!-- My hobbies include building computers, bicycling, martial arts, cooking, and web design. I'm also an independent web development contracter and consultant that is available for freelance work. You can read more about me, my experience, skills, why you should hire me and my CV below.
