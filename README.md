My personal portfolio website.

It's a statically hosted Jekyll site which is pretty neat. You can learn more about jekyll (which I recommend) at https://jekyllrb.com.

This project is under the MIT license so you can technically use anything you think is interesting in here in your own projects if it'll help you learn or whatever. Just don't copy other people's stuff that doesn't ever help anyone.
