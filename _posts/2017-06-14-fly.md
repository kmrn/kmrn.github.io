FLY is a short film about a boy up late studying but this pesky fly just won't let him. I wrote, produced, and directed fly and pulled together a crack team of other members of the Florida Polytechnic media club to create this short piece. We shot it in over the course of about 3 hours one Wednesday night.

Well the end result is, *Hey, we tried.* Yeah it might not be that great but that's mostly my fault. This was my first film project but I plan for it to be the first of many. I also designed and pieced together that wonderful fly costume using some things I picked up at Walmart a few hours before shooting. Our editor, Ted, made the really subpar footage I gave him work surprisingly well. He did a pretty great job considering what he had to work with. The actors were all great and super easy to work with and I love all of them. My boy Travis was handling the camera the whole time and brought a lot of great ideas to the table with that too.

This script didn't have a ton of dialogue so it wasn't really a big chance for me to shine. Memorable lines such as "What?" or "Huh!?" unfortunately don't really sell me as a writer.

New screenplays are being written and more videos are COMING SOON.
