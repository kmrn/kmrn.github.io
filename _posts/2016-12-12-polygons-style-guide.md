I was the project manager for a large group project in which we had to design the concept for a game and then pitch that idea to the class as a fleshed out idea. One of the components of our final submission was a style guide for the game written by and featuring pixel art from yours truly.

<div class="row">
	<div class="one-third column">
		<img class="one-third-image" src="/images/polygonwars_styleguide/polygon1.png">
	</div>
	<div class="one-third column">
		<img class="one-third-image" src="/images/polygonwars_styleguide/polygon2.png">
	</div>
	<div class="one-third column">
		<img class="one-third-image" src="/images/polygonwars_styleguide/polygon3.png">
	</div>
</div>

What you'll find in this document is 10 pages of images and text detailing the best practices and artistic guidelines of working within our project. The goal of this, as with most style guides, was to enforce a sense of consistency across all of the assets we needed to create as a team of almost 10 different people.
