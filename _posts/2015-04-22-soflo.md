This project was more of a portfolio building excercise. I built it from scratch during my spare time over a few days. It's for the place where I learned to play bass.

###Technologies
This website was built, templated, and compiled using [HarpJS](https://harpjs.com/). I think Harp is a pretty rad platform and helps you push out fast and solid static sites pretty quickly. I wanted to try something new so I decided to use a templating HTML preprocessor called [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/). It seemed like a good idea (even though I've never liked indentation syntax) and the project went pretty smoothly. While a little easier and sometimes faster, that indentation syntax can get really ugly really fast. Next time I'll probably use [EJS](http://www.embeddedjs.com/) since it's more like regular HTML.

For styling I used SCSS, like I normally do. Harp makes that really easy since it's dev server automagically compiles it for you. For a boilerplate to get things rolling quickly, I used [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). It seems like everyone uses it so I might as well learn how to use it too. I called it using a CDN because I didn't really feel like installing it. I've been told that it's not always great to do that, but hey, [Google says it's faster](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/) so whatever.
