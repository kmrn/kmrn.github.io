This project was more of a portfolio building excercise. I built it from scratch during my spare time over a few days. It's for the place where I learned to play bass.

### Technologies
This website was built, templated, and compiled using [HarpJS](https://harpjs.com/). I think Harp is a pretty rad platform and helps you push out fast and solid static sites pretty quickly. I wanted to try something new so I decided to use a templating HTML preprocessor called [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/). It seemed like a good idea (even though I've never liked indentation syntax) and the project went pretty smoothly. While a little easier and sometimes faster, that indentation syntax can get really ugly really fast. Next time I'll probably use [EJS](http://www.embeddedjs.com/) since it's more like regular HTML.

For styling I used SCSS, like I normally do. Harp makes that really easy since its dev server automatically compiles it for you. For a boilerplate to get things rolling quickly, I used [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). It seems like everyone uses it so I might as well learn how to use it too. I called it using a CDN because I didn't really feel like installing it. I've been told that it's not always great to do that, but hey, [Google says it's faster](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/) so whatever.

### Design
The original website has lots of photography. Good, non-stock photography is always good for websites, especially if they're implemented into the design well. I figured it was important, so I tried to add a lot in what I thought was the right ways. A lot of the images might seem a little low resolution, but I worked with what was available to me.

This site is a little more flat than my portfolio website. I'm not sure why. I guesss I just thought flat was better suited for this project? Whatever the reason, it's flat with some raised accents, like images and buttons. I thought it looked nice at least.

### Colors
As for color, I thought a simple slightly off white would do nicely for the background. To add a splash of color I tried to got with a light blue theme. The variation of light blue is from the [Material Design Spec](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html).

<table class="kracker-colors">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="title">Primary Color</th>
      <!--<th class="title">Darker</th>-->
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="lb-medium">#03A9F4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="lb-darker">#0288D1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<style>
  .lb-medium { background-color: #03A9F4; }
  .lb-darker { background-color: #0288D1; }
  .lb-medium,
  .lb-darker { color: #fff; text-align: center; }
</style>

Lastly, if you live in the area and want to learn how to play an instrument, SoFLo Music School is great. They're extremely nice and great instructors. Chris, the owner, was actually the one who first got me into learning how to play the bass. I guess just [check out the website for more info](http://www.soflomusicschool.com/ "Music School"). Both sites have the same info on them.
