What this is.

This is a blog. It's my blog. Do people read it? Hell if I know. It's just a blog I guess. Since Jekyll is a blogging engine, and this site is built on Jekyll, I figured it might as well have a blog. 

This blog is pretty much meant for the following stuff:

<ul class="bloglist">
    <li>Developer Diaries</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Status of ongoing projects</li>
        <li>Discussing challenges I may face developing something.</li>
        <li>Sharing technologies.</li>
        <li>That sort of thing.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Bloggy stuff</li>
    <ul>
        <li>stuff you would find on the blogs of other stuff</li>
        <li>maybe I need to explain a tool I made</li>
        <li>maybe I want to rant about something</li>
        <li>whatever</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Personal stuff maybe?</li>
    <ul><li>probably not</li></ul>
</ul>
<style>.bloglist { list-decoration: dotted; }</style>
    
This blog is pretty much a way for me to get thoughts on paper. It also helps me become a better typist I guess. Yeah sure, lets go with that.
