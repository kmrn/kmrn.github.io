What this is.

This is a blog. It's my blog. Do people read it? Hell if I know. It's just a blog I guess. Since Jekyll is a blogging engine, and this site is built on Jekyll, I figured it might as well have a blog. 

This blog is pretty much meant for the following stuff:

* Developer Diaries
    * Status of ongoing projects
    * Discussing challenges I may face developing something.
    * Sharing technologies.
    * That sort of thing.
* Bloggy stuff
    * stuff you would find on the blogs of other stuff
    * maybe I need to explain a tool I made
    * maybe I want to rant about something
    * whatever
* Personal stuff maybe?
    * probably not
    
This blog is pretty much a way for me to get thoughts on paper. It also helps me become a better typist I guess. Yeah sure, lets go with that.
