title: The Ending's Finality
---

A while ago I wrote a blog post about the concept of never-ending games and the use of procedural generation. Right now I’m talking about something in a similar vein to that but more from a narrative perspective. There are some MAJOR *Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP* spoilers in this article. I’ve heard of studies where knowing the ending of something can actually make the story more enjoyable but if you’re not okay with trying that experiment on yourself stop reading and go play that wonderful game! Also be sure to play it with headphones. I also talk about *The Witcher 3* ending but there aren’t really any spoilers.

It’s no secret that one of my all time favorite games is *Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP* on the iPad. The creation of composer Jim Guthrie, Capybara Games, and illustration company Superbrothers. I say “on the iPad” because the game was designed to be a touch based experience, I feel like just a little of the magic is lost without that actually touching the world and other platform specific details that made the game that much more special.

Part of what keeps this experience so memorable aside from its relative brevity and creative use of the medium was its flowing narrative that brings the world to life and the player into that world. From the start of the game you experience the world through the Scythian, embarking on her “woeful errand”. It is immediately clear that is someone from a distant land in a place that predates her arrival. As the story progresses and the same few characters remain throughout and finally, the Scythian’s journey culminates in a climactic battle with the physical form taken by the Gogolothic Mass at the summit of Mingi Taw. The Scythian defeats the Three Eyed Wolf, but at the cost of her own life. In completing one of my favorite endings in the history of the medium, the three new friends of the Scythian encountered at the beginning of the story, recover and somberly cremate her body. We see her friends return to their humble lives on the mountain. The story completes with firm and permanent ending to the Scythian’s arc. However, in some ways, the story continues. After the credits roll and the game is put away the world lives on without you, just as it did before you, but forever changed by your brief presence.

Another game I’d like to reference is *The Witcher 3*. Another near-perfect experience that held on to my attention and refused to let go. Intricate story telling and Tolstoy-esque sideshadowing in a carefully woven yet expansive narrative. After reaching the ending of this story, though, I was reminded of the power that the destination wields over how someone remembers the journey. After seeing the final scene unfold as a result of some of the key decisions I made throughout the story, I was rewarded with a brief narration telling me how everything worked out for Geralt and the love interest he settled with as well as the larger powers at play. I was a little disappointed to not hear anything about any of the friends that had been with me until the end of the game or what had happened to them. After the credits I was placed back into the world as it was right before the final chapter, or at least, a version of it that lacked all of the main characters. For all intents and purposes, this similar post-game world was my destination. It’s the last place I was when I stopped playing the game and thus the my most recent memory of the story.

While Witcher 3’s technical *ending* was satisfying, it tacked on an additional piece that became what the player will inevitably feel is the true ending. *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* gave players something similar, by taking them to just before the final fight. The difference between these two is that the player is taken to exactly the same place they were just before setting the ending in motion. Everyone is where they were left and all the people met along the journey still live within the world. While this might not fully satisfy the desire to see what happens next, it still accomplishes a firm ending, implies more goes on after the ending, and lets players continue to experience the world. This implementation of post-ending content, leaves the narrative intact by dropping players back into a part of the narrative they’re already familiar with. Instead, *Witcher 3* places you into a version of the same setting, where the narrative you experienced feels as though it hasn’t occurred. CD Projekt Red’s approach to this was flawed in that it alters the player’s perspective on the current ‘state’ of the world.

A story maintains the lasting magic by making the world feel as alive as possible. In order to create the illusion of life the world must appear to *live*, even after the fade to black.
