        It's generally pretty easy to get a hold of me. You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/kamranpayne">@KamranPayne</a>, Google Plus <a href="https://plus.google.com/103628236655675054899">over here</a>, or send me an email at <a href="mailto:mail@kamranpayne.com">mail@kamranpayne.com</a>. For your added convenience, there's also a contact form right there <i class="fa fa-arrow-down"></i>.

          <h4>Form of Contacting</h4>
          <p>I had to get rid of the form because I was only getting spam from it. Sorry for the subtracted convenience.</p>
